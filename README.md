## Quantification of Demand Response provided by Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
This is a set of Matlab codes that simulates the building internal temperature profile and load profile when HVAC is functioning to maintain the set temperature. This program also calculates the demand response potential for each time interval of pre-specified length, e.g. 5, 10 and 15mins. Symbolic Math Toolbox is required to run this program.

The main program is *SimulationStart.m*. 

* 3-bus test system: the original data of this test case are from the following reference: <a class="off" href="/resources/ECE6379-PSOM/"  target="_blank">Li, Xingpeng (2021): ECE6379_PSOM.zip. figshare. Online resource. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.17161805.v1</a>


### Input files:
1. InitializationStructure.txt - Contains all basic parameters required by the program with "\n" as delimiter. Parameters are explained below:

		1. Number_of_houses
		2. ThermalResistanceUpperLimit
		3. ThermalResistanceLowerLimit
		4. KW_ratings_of_HVAC
		5. Temp_deadband
		6. InternalTemperatureUpperLimit 
		7. InternalTemperatureLowerLimit
		8. HeatRateUpperLimit
		9. HeatRateLowerLimit 
		10. HeatOutRateUpperLimit
		11. HeatOutRateLowerLimit
		12. AirHeatUpperLimit
		13. AirHeatLowerLimit
		14. TempSetUpperLimit
		15. TempSetLowerLimit
		16. simulationTimeinMinm 
		17. DRstarttime
		
2. TemperatureOfTheDay.txt (Temperature of the day) - Contains the 'Tout' or the ambient temperature (in Fahrenheit or F) outside of the room/house. 
                            The file should contain (Hours_needed_to_simulate * 60) lines of temperature values.
							The temporal resolution of the input temperature data is a MINUTE.
                            For example: if the temperature for the first hour is 80F, then the 1st 60 lines of the file will have "80". Likewise it should be filled for every hour for the program to function properly.
Note: All input files must be in the same folder as the matlab codes.

### Program flow:
 1. Starts From "SimulationStart.m" file
           - Performs basic parameters reading from input files
           - Transfers control to "TemperatureInitializationMode.m"
 2. In "TemperatureInitializationMode.m"
           - Calculates the maximum support times that HVACs are capable of.
           - Calculates Temperature profile and load profile for the whole simulation period/day
           - Calculates normalized load values for every time resolution specified (e.g., 5,10,15mins) 
           - Calculates Demand Response potential for every time resolution specified (e.g., 5,10,15mins) 
           - Returns control to "SimulationStart.m" file
3. In "SimulationStart.m" file
           - Stores the simulated values in variable "msg"
           - Also display the run time for whole simulation in variable "timeE"
           - In a Intel i7, 16GB Ram computer, the program had runtime of 10mins for simulating 100 houses and 1 simulation    period (30 minutes).
4. "msg" Profile includes all the simulation results in 10 cells
	   -cell (1,1): House parameter details; HVAC on/off status; House temperature;
	   -cell (1,2): HVAC demand response available time for each HVAC system;
	   -cell (1,3): Load Profile
	   -cell (1,4): Load Profile at a 5 minutes time interval;
	   -cell (1,5): Total HVAC demand response available time and availble status for 5 minutes for each time period;


The power flow results are compared and verified with the results obtained from Matpower using Newton's method. For small-to-medium test cases, it works very well. For the large-scale 2383-bus system, obvious mismatches between this program and Matpower are observed. Not sure what made the difference; possibly (i) the cases used by two tools are not entirely the same; (ii) difference between Newton's method and Fast Decoupled method; (iii) different control schemes; e.g., this program does not adjust transformer taps or shunts.
